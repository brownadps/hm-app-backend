To test your dev changes do the following:

docker stop hm

docker rm hm

./hm-run.sh

It will build a docker image and create a new container.

You can view the webpage at https://brownadphi.org/hm.

NOTE: The paths in the Express app should not include the '/hm'. I am removing that in the server config.
